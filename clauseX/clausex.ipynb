The study has some limitations due to the sample group: The sample is heterogeneous with regard to substance and level of substance intake. Therefore, some of the variabil- ity in terms of personality disorder severity may be related to variability in substance-related problems, especially chronic substance-related problems. However, when the patients were rated by clinicians, they were actively involved in treatment, and the most acute substance- related problems that could mimic personality disorders would likely be reduced at this point. A further limitation is that we did not collect information about the number of contacts or the amount of time spent with patients. We did have some information about the type of contact. Further studies of interrater agreement of comorbid per- sonality disorders can benefit from including detailed information on level and kind of drug intake as well as conducting the rating at a certain point after beginning of treatment. However, the method used resembles clinical practice, where it is often not clear at the beginning of treatment, what personality disorders a patient has, yet cli- nicians make observations and judgments about patients' long-standing problems and traits [7]. A further limitation was the absence of self-reported data on personality disorders from a self-report inventory or a semi-structured interview. The study could therefore only rate to what extent two external observers would make the same observations. On the other hand, semi-structured interviews and inventories are susceptible to biases, both in the form of impression management and patients' var- ying degree of insight into their problems.\"),\n",

Firstly, I was unable to recruit enough prenatal educators in the rural perinatal regions of Macon and Albany to host focus groups in each of these regions. The few participants I recruited from these regions reported they were not aware of many other educators in the area. Additionally, they voiced to me the concern that they, as well as other maternal health professionals in the region, were extremely busy. Only two prenatal educators were recruited from the Albany perinatal region and two were recruited from the Macon perinatal region. These participants joined virtually during the Augusta focus group. Ideally, hosting focus groups in each of these regions would have allowed for greater diversity in perspective and feedback. Moreover, only two of the six scheduled participants of the Atlanta focus group attended the session. Learning from this first focus group experience, I aimed to over-recruit 12 or more participants for the remaining three focus groups. Having over five participants for the Atlanta focus group would have allowed for more feedback from urban providers, clinicians, and educators. Additionally, the Savannah focus group was rescheduled to a virtual Zoom group instead of in person as a result of Hurricane Dorian. Attendants and I were unable to attend in person due to the severe nature of this storm. Although we had numerous scheduled participants for the original focus group, several were unable to attend even virtually due to this storm. A total of five participants joined the Zoom focus group. It was clear that these Zoom participants were not as apt to speak and required more prompting to obtain in-depth responses. Ideally, all focus groups would have been held in person to foster a sense of comfort and connection to allow for easier participation. In terms of implementing this toolkit, it is important to note that it is not generalizable outside the state of Georgia. Although some of the content may be applicable for prenatal educators in other states, this was not confirmed by the HMHB 2018 research project. All focus groups took place within the state. Furthermore, because the toolkit was disseminated via email and is on HMHB’s website, it is not as available to prenatal educators that may not have access to computers or the internet. Maternal and infant health organizations in other regions of the United States should carry out evaluations similar to HMHB’s 2018 resear...'),\n",
